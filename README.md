You can use this code in any project you'd like and modify it however you want. You can also credit me if you want

If you're just copying the function that makes the bot work, dont forget that it's written in TypeScript. So you'll either have to fiddle around with the `.ts` file or just copy straight from the `.js` file. And dont forget to run `npm install mathjs` since it depends on it
